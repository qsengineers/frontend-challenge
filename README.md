# Challenge - Front End Developer
If you are here, you probably have already started the interview process and we're off to a great start :)

The idea here is to build an application with restaurant details and with its own menu.

Customer then will be able to see each item and add it in the basket.

# What should you expect in this code challenge?
This challenge is halfway through your job application at Qikserve. If you got here it means we've had a good start.

When it's delivered, we will review your code, give you feedback and proceed to the next steps of your job application.

# How can I submit the results?
Create a new repository, build your awesome menu solution and then send it over to ronaldo.zanoni@qikserve.com and caio.ricci@qikserve.com as collaborators to your project.

Build a great READ.ME explaining how to run your code, your assumptions, process and choices and anything else you think we should know about your delivery and yourself.
